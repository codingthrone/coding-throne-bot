# Commands

Commands for the general category should be placed within the general folder.
For other categories, the according files would go into the corresponding category folder. If there is none, please create it.

Other than that, currently not sure about which library we will be using as far as discord.js for ts is concerned.
Currently in use npm package "@typeit/discord".
Currently, I suggest creating commands like in ./ping.ts via the CommandBuilder for future proofing, incase we decide to create our own wrapper or change.
